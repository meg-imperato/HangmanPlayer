# HangmanPlayer
This Java program efficiently plays hangman against the user. The program guesses based on a hashmap of letters and cooresponding frequencies. The hashmap is created by reading a scrabble dictionary text file and using regular expressions to determine when a letter's frequency should be incremented.
